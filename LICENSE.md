# License
As specified by the terms for KSP mods, all mods need to come with a license. 

This mod was created by *Eric PÃ¶hlsen* - https://www.eric-poehlsen.de

Any license granted below is of course limited by Squads Copyright on Kerbal Space Program. 

## The KSP addon
The packed mod (the stuff within the GameData directory) is licensed as CC-BY-NC-ND 3.0

## Code
The programmatic code of the mod is to be regarded as **open source**. Use it as inspiration, copy parts you might find useful for your mods. Just please don't copy the whole thing and take credit for it, because that is not what **open source** means. If you want to give me credit, just add a link to my website or the github repository. If you want a standard license - the code is hereby released CC-0 and MIT License (whatever suits your needs)

## Graphics
The graphics and artwork (models and textures) should not be reused for other mods. If you really want to, please ask. Well that technically makes the CC-BY-NC-ND 3.0

## The Octogon Group
The **Octogon Group** and it's subsidiaries are a fictional corporation that I do use in stories and role-playing games. All rights reserved in that area.

In the context of Kerbal Space Program I introduce the company as manufacturer of the parts I am modding. Please do not reuse the name or logos for your parts. For game content (logos, texts, etc.) treat this as CC-BY-NC-ND 3.0
